I'm Oreh Okumbili. And I'm Jason Palmer. Every weekday, we provide a fresh perspective on the events shaping your world. Let's go for a little ride, shall we? Not in a car, no. Not even in a bus or a truck, but in a robo taxi. The self-driving cars are a polarizing topic in California. But with expansion on the horizon, we chat with our correspondent to see if he's on board. And the sea ice in Antarctica comes and goes with the seasons. The amount that it goes in the summer has long worried climatologists. But there's a newer, worrying trend. It's not coming back as much even in the continent's winter. First up, though... Country Garden, one of China's housing giants, is looking shaky, and that creates worries right across the Chinese economy. Housing markets are always a reasonable chunk of the economic system. But in China, that chunk is enormous, accounting for perhaps 30% of the country's GDP. That's why last year, when the heavily indebted housing firm Evergrande defaulted, it sent shivers through the spines of everyone from government officials to home buyers. The thing is, for the average Chinese citizen, there's not a lot of places to invest. Access to stock markets is tricky, and access to international markets all but impossible. So savers invest in housing, often putting down huge sums for homes not yet built. And when they have reason to lose faith in those investments, they lose faith in the economy as a whole. We're moving into the next stage of China's long-running housing crisis. Don Wineland is The Economist's China Business and Finance Editor. And it's just one of many problems that are hitting the Chinese economy right now. You say it's a long-running housing crisis. Let's wind back a bit. What's going on in that score? So if you look back over the past couple decades, China's housing market has been one of the cornerstones of the economy. And it's really just gone from strength to strength. Housing prices have been increasing very, very quickly. Many people have been putting their money into housing with the idea that prices would only go up. So it's always been a very safe bet. In 2020, the government decided to crack down on leverage in the sector, which is incredibly high. And since then, things have gone very poorly for the housing sector. Some of the biggest companies, such as Evergrande, have come tumbling down. Evergrande defaulted in 2021. And it's really just gotten worse and worse since then. And what is it that's brought this back to the fore now? So the thing that everybody's talking about right now is this company called Country Garden. If you look back at the beginning of the housing crisis, everybody was very worried about companies like Evergrande. And there's a long list of names of troubled companies. Country Garden was always cited as being a strong developer that was not going to succumb to the same problems as these other highly leveraged weak developers. But lo and behold, on August 6th, Country Garden missed a coupon payment to some of its investors. It has until early September to make that payment, but the damage has been done. Its bonds are trading at pennies on the dollar before they were halted. And it's really causing a bit of a panic, not just in the housing market, but in cross markets in China, so in the stock market. And I think just generally for households, people are very worried about this. And we talked a lot on the show last year about Evergrande when it defaulted on its debts, and that essentially was bec"}, "podcast_summary": "Janice Torres from Yo Quiero Dinero promotes the partnership between Bank of America and local businesses, emphasizing access to digital tools and business solutions.
