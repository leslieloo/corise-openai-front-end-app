My name is Seb. I'm Doug. And I'm Lewis. On today's episode, Duck getting victimized again by another hit and run, the Model Y hardware for controversy, the return of the battery swap, and a quick review of the latest Tesla podcast, Land of the Giants. Episode 48 starts now. Gentlemen, hello. Good to see you guys. Hey. I think somebody was saying that we're running late, which is not true because you're in Italy, Doug. So we're on Italian time where dinner starts at 10 PM, apparently. Pretty much. And it's actually pretty much dinner time right now. So I'm going to put off my dinner until we're done with this. But yeah, it's a little late. It's a little late here. I'm dressed for the part. I love it. I love the hat. Yeah. I'm offended. Don't be offended. Hey, I'm part Italian. But yeah, it helps with the... I tried to get the sun off your face too much, but it breathes, you know? So it turned out to be the best hat. My normal TAMO shanter, you know, newsboy was just too warm. It's been hot actually, but the weather was pretty good for most of my time here. Still warm, but you know, and I've been sort of around the country. I'm in Rome now and it's pretty hot here. It's like 90 degrees, but it's still better than, I think like a couple of weeks ago or so, it was over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. I was told like 40 Celsius, which is terrible. It's terribly hot. Oh, you would know. You speak European. I speak metric, yeah. Yeah. So anyway, it's been a nice time here. Doesn't sound that hot to me, but I'm in Austin, so we're every day is over 40. Well, I mean, you know, it's the whole climate change thing, right? I mean, I mean, Maui is on fire, right? And it's terrible. And we've had that happen in California. And, you know, amazingly, that was happening in Canada, of all places, you know, some like a month or so ago. So yeah, we got an EV, right? That's where you're going with that. Yeah, buy an EV. But, you know, it takes more than that. So I don't know. That's a that's another podcast, I guess. Probably. Well, thanks for making time. I know it's late. So kind of walk us through the preparation for this trip, right? I think you're going to be in Italy for another 10 days or so. You get ready for this trip, you pack, you make sure you pack that fancy hat you're wearing. Uh huh. No, I bought this year, obviously. The night before you leave, what happens to your car? Ah, you know, this is such a rough thing. So, you know, I, I'm fairly mobile. And so, you know, my car has to sit someplace when I'm someplace else. And, you know, I've had a couple times, okay, I'm leaving my car somewhere. And I had a trip to California that I expected to only be a few days and I didn't put the cover on the car. And then while I was gone, you know, I was under a tree and got a bunch of bird poo on it, you know. So this time I'm like, okay, let me make sure I get the cover on it. I know I'm going to be gone for a little while. And I parked the car, not in the driveway, but sort of on the street because I want to wash it before I put the cover on. And, uh, yeah. So, you know, a few, gee, I guess how many months ago was that? That was, when was it? I forget. Last time I had a, I got hit and run before, right? Um, and some guys, and we showed video of it and these guys, and I was there. I like saw it happen or at least heard it happen. And these dudes, uh, just sort of pulled out and, and peered out and left. So here it is. Yeah. The night before I'm about to go. And I didn't find this out until the morning of when I'm about to get picked up. Uh, and, uh, here, let's, uh, let's, let's roll the, let's roll the tape. Uh, let's see, what's the best way to do this? Uh, oh, there it is. Here we go. Okay. What do we got here? It had to be a pickup truck too. Yeah. So part of the problem here is that this road is, you know, for those who can't see it, sort of some video here, this road is a dead end.
